# Solana Rust Smart Contract: Register Devices

## Overview
This Solana Rust smart contract facilitates the registration of devices onto the Solana blockchain. It allows for the initialization of device objects, storing essential device information securely on the blockchain.

## Features
- **Device Registration:** Devices can be registered on the blockchain with associated metadata such as MAC address and device name.
- **Secure Storage:** Device information is securely stored on the Solana blockchain, ensuring immutability and transparency.
- **Authority Management:** The contract allows for authority management, ensuring that only authorized wallets can register devices.

## Getting Started
To use this smart contract, follow these steps:
1. **Setup Development Environment:** Ensure you have Rust and the Solana tool suite installed on your development environment.
1. **Clone Repository:** Clone this repository onto your local machine.
1. **Compile and Deploy:** Compile the smart contract using the Solana build tools and deploy it onto the Solana blockchain.
1. **Interact with the Contract:** Once deployed, interact with the smart contract using Solana wallets to initialize device objects and register devices.

## Usage
To interact with the smart contract, you can utilize Solana wallets or custom scripts. Here's a brief overview of the available functionality:
- **Initialize Device:** Use the initialize_device function to initialize a device object on the blockchain with provided metadata (MAC address and device name).
